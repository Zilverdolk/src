TODO:
~Finish getting the GUI worked out (Find better method for button arrangement? maybe horizontal)
~Get custom textures for Workbench Buttons (maybe later)
~Add shift-clicking in Workbench Gui for custom Items/Slots
~Actually texture the Workbench (work on 3d model later)
~Setup the powerChest as a base item to extend
~Setup API for card limits
~Add Round function to -1 and +1 buttons
~Fix Leggings Rendering (Something with Layer 2)
Ideas:
~Card that can interact with your inventory, syncs with chest (goes on the pants, cuz ender pockets)
