TODO:
~Finish getting the GUI worked out (Custom Settings; probably need another network class)
~Get custom textures for Workbench Buttons (maybe later)
~Add shift-clicking in Workbench Gui for custom Items/Slots
~Find better spot for the card functions (allow additions with API) (create itemstack from the item name(code in the container class) and get the class from the item, execute a common function in that class)
~Setup Jump Card
Ideas:
~Card that can interact with your inventory, syncs with chest (goes on the pants, cuz ender pockets)
